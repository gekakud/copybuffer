# WHAT IS COPYBUFFER #

When you copy or cut text in Windows, it's copied by CopyBuffer creating clipboard history. Later you can view your clipboard history and paste from it.

# HOWTO #

Download Windows version from releases, install it, run it.
To view your clipboard history, tap the Ctrl + Q keyboard shortcut - CopyBuffer panel will open that will list all text items(images will be added also later), that you copied to your clipboard. Scroll through it and click an item you want to paste again.
